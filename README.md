#Repair Depot
This application is focused on building a central place to store all repair info needed for an in-depot shop.

To accomplis this goal I will need to set some basic rules.
1. Define our application needs
2. Define our backend
3. Define our frontend
4. Build our API communication
5. Create our Database Schema
6. How will I manage this project

##Application Needs
This section will be in continual growth. This will contain 3 categories. 
1. Must Have
2. Need
3. Would like to have

Think of this structure like a Kanban Board.
Everything starts in the "Would like to have", then moves to the "Need", from there gets set to the "Must Have." Since I am
working on this project alone, I will never have more than 3 in the "Must Have", or I will lose track.
